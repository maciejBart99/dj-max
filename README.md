# dj-max
Complete backend for a virtual Dj app with my own implementation of CQRS.

## About
The main idea of this app is to use the Spotify Web Playback API to create and listen to music in virtual rooms. This light Spring backend provide very simple functionalities for creating rooms and adding songs, but the frontend part is still missing.

## TODO
There is still a cuple of things that has to be done, for instance, some kind of authorzation and auto-delete of abandoned rooms.
